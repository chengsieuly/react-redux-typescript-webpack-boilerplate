# React, Redux, React Router, TypeScript, SASS, Webpack Quickstart Boilerplate

Grabbing a boilerplate should be easy. No complicated stuff - just a simple and quick way to
prototype an application or try a new framework or library. This is why I built this
boilerplate meant for front-end development who are deciding to use this stack
or similar. Get up and running quick with some of the most common or uprising technologies
and not have to worry about complicated boilerplate stuff.
